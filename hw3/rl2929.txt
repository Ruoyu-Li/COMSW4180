1. Yes, humans are. Here are the reasons:
(a) Attacks on humans (social engineering, mainly including phishing and pretexting) have a high frequency. According to Verizon 2017 report, there are 1617 incidents and 828 with confirmed data disclosure, which is one of the most frequent attack types. 
(b) It can make a significant impact on privacy and security. Once successfully phished, a number of things can happen: software installation, influencing disclosure of sensitive data, repurposing of assets and so on. Almost all phishing attacks that led to a breach were followed by some form of malware, and 28% of phishing breaches were targeted.
(c) Public administration is the major victim of this type of attacks. According to Verizon 2017 report, Public Administration and Manufacturing represent over half of the victims in this subset of data, and trade secrets are the top data variety targeted, followed by the personal information.
(d) It is very easy to get hooked by the attack, but people may not realize its jeopardy. Via a link or an opened attachment, 7.3% of users across multiple data contributors were successfully phished. In a typical company (with 30 or more employees), about 15% of all unique users who fell victim once, 3% of all unique users clicked more than twice. But even reporting is key to limiting the effectiveness of phishing, people tend to let it go instead of reporting. Of those that had recorded instances of reporting, the percentage of users who reported was only 20%.

2. GM Bot uses keystroke-captureing website overlays. Since it infects mobile handsets it can steal two factor authentication including SMS and even redirect phone calls.
Any website or banking app that can be used to harvest credentials and tokens from infected phones are targets of GM Bot.

3. Diffie-Hellman protocol.
After getting the structure with the shellcode by that means (encrypted with a one-time key by using the Diffie-Hellman protocol), the exploit kit sample becomes unusable after one processing: the analyst is unable to understand what a specific file does, reproduce the attack, and, quite often, identify the exploit and vulnerability at all.

4.
(a) Star topology. Since the botnet relies upon a single centralized C&C resource to communicate with all bot agents, it can suffer single point of failure: If the central C&C is blocked or otherwise disabled, the botnet is effectively neutered.
(b) Random topology. Because it has no centralized C&C infrastructure and commands are injected in to the botnet via any bot agent. It is highly resilient to shutdown and hijacking because it lacks centralized C&C and employs multiple communication paths between bot agents.

5
(a) Mimikatz
(b) PowerShell
(c) 53%
(d) JavaScript downloaders. Office documents with malicious macros (W97M.Downloader and variants).
(e) 76%. No.

6. Disk-wiping.
PsExec; PAExec; Netscan; Samdump; Mimikatz; TightVNC; Plink; Rar

7.
It's a botnet behind a wave of major DDoS attacks. The Mirai botnet, which is made up of IoT devices, was used in a number of high-profile distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks towards the end of 2016.
IoT devices.
